[Primitive data type, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type)

In computer science, 


Primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use. Most processors support a similar set of primitive data types, although the specific representations vary.

More generally, "primitive data types" **may refer to the standard data types built into a programming language**. Data types which are not primitive are referred to as derived or composite.

Primitive types are almost always value types, but composite types may also be value types.
