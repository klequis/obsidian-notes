## Folding a list (reduction)
- An iteration over a list to produce a singleton value is called a _fold_
- There are several variations: 
	- folding from the left, 
	- folding from the right, 
	- several variations having to do with “initialisation”, 
	- and some more advanced variations.

`foldr`
- divides each element in the list (from right to left) by the accumulator.

```haskell
foldr (/) 1 [2,4,8]
```

Answer: 4

element / accumulator

8/1     = 8
4/8    = 0.5
2/0.5 = 4


`2/(4/(8/1))`
`x1/(x2/(x3/acc))`




`foldl`
- divides the accumulator by each element in the list (from left to right).

```haskell
foldl (/) 16 [8,4,2,1]
```

Answer: 0.25

accumulator / element

16/8     = 2
2/4      = 0.5
0.5/2   = 0.25
0.25/1 = 0.25

`(((16/8)/4)/2)/1`
`(((acc/8)/4)/2)/1`

```haskell
foldr (/) 1 [2,4,8]
( Cons 2 ( Cons 4 ( Cons 8 1)))
(    / 2 (    / 4 (    / 8 1)))
```

```haskell
foldl (/) 16 [8,4,2,1]
( Cons 16 8 ( Cons 4 ( Cons 2 ( Cons 1))))
(    / 1  8 (    / 4 (    / 2 (    / 1)))) 


```

----
```haskell
foldl (/) 2 [1,2,3]
```

((2/1)/2)/3

```haskell
foldr (/) 2 [1,2,3]
```


## 3.10 Custom Data Types

Are generally called _algebraic data types_.

**Sum data type example**

"Algebraic sums"

```haskell
data SimpleNumber = One | Two | Many
```


**Product data type example**

"Algebraic products"

This particular product data type is also a _record_ data type. 

> Not clear to me if all product data types are record data types or not.

```haskell
data CricketScore = Score [Char] Int Int
	deriving Show
```

"`Score` is a _type constructor_ that takes a `String` and two `Int` arguments and returns a `CricketScore` value"

```haskell
> let x = Score "New Zealand" 350 4
> x
Score "New Zealand" 350 4
```
