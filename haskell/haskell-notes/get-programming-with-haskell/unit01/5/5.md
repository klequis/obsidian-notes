# 5 CLOSURES AND PARTIAL APPLICATION


>[!INFORMATION] I started thinking I should fill in the definition of the bullet points that are at the beginning of each lesson. However, I didn't finish here because have other stuff to do this morning.


## Capture values in a lambda expression

```haskell
genIfEven f = (\x -> ifEven f x)
```

- The function `f` that you passed in is captured inside the lambda function! 
- When you **capture** a value inside a lambda function, it is referred to as a **closure**.

## Use closures to create new functions



## Simplify this process with partial application
