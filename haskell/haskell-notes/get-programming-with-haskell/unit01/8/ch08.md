## 8.3.1 Ackermann function

```haskell
ackermann 0 n = n + 1
ackermann m 0 = ackermann (m-1) 1
ackermann m n = ackermann (m-1) (ackermann m (n-1))
```

Using this lookup table:

|     |   |   |   |                |
|-----|---|---|---|----------------|
| ack | 0 | 0 |   |                |
| ack | 0 | 1 |   | 2              |
| ack | 0 | 2 |   | 3              |
| ack | 0 | 3 |   | 4              |
| ack | 0 | 4 |   | 5              |
| ack | 1 | 0 |   | ack 0 1        |
| ack | 1 | 1 |   | ack 0 (ack 1 0 |
| ack | 1 | 2 |   | ack 0 (ack 1 1 |
| ack | 1 | 3 |   | ack 0 (ack 1 2 |
| ack | 1 | 4 |   | ack 0 (ack 1 3 |
| ack | 1 | 5 |   | ack 0 (ack 1 4 |
| ack | 2 | 0 |   | ack 1 1        |
| ack | 2 | 1 |   | ack 1 (ack 2 0 |
| ack | 2 | 2 |   | ack 1 (ack 2 1 |

`ack 2 2` works out as follows:

| m | n |                                            |
|---|---|--------------------------------------------|
| 2 | 2 | ack 1 (ack 2 1                             |
| 2 | 0 | ack 1 (ack 1 (ack 2 0                      |
| 1 | 1 | ack 1 (ack 1 (ack 1 1                      |
| 1 | 0 | ack 1 (ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 1 0               |
| 0 | 1 | ack 1 (ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 0 1               |
| 0 | 2 | ack 1 (ack 1 (ack 0 2                      |
| 1 | 3 | ack 1 (ack 1 3                             |
| 1 | 2 | ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 1 2                      |
| 1 | 1 | ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 1 1               |
| 1 | 0 | ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 1 0        |
| 0 | 1 | ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 1        |
| 0 | 2 | ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 2               |
| 0 | 3 | ack 1 (ack 0 (ack 0 3                      |
| 1 | 4 | ack 0 (ack 1 4                             |
| 1 | 3 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 1 3                      |
| 1 | 2 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 1 2               |
| 1 | 1 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 1 1        |
| 1 | 0 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 1 0 |
| 0 | 1 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 1 |
| 0 | 2 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 2        |
| 0 | 3 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 3               |
| 0 | 4 | ack 0 (ack 0 (ack 0 4                      |
| 0 | 5 | ack 0 (ack 0 5                             |
| 0 | 6 | ack 0 6                                    |
|   | 7 | 7                                          |


Using larger values, `ack` becomes very resource and time consuming.
