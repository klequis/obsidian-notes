# Lesson 3: Lambda Functions and Lexical Scope

## Replace where clause with lambda function
*Section 3.2*

```haskell
sumSquareOrSquareSum x y = if sumSquare > squareSum
                           then sumSquare
                           else squareSum
  where sumSquare = x^2 + y^2
        squareSum = (x+y)^2
```

```haskell
sumSquareOrSquareSum x y = 
(\sumSquare squareSum -> 
  if sumSquare > squareSum
  then sumSquare
  else squareSum) (x^2 + y^2) ((x+y)^2)
```

- Embed the `if then else` in a lambda
- Pass the equations for `sumSquare` and `squareSum` in as parameters to the lambda

## Let vs Where

- Like lambdas, `let` is an expression
- `let` is an alternative to `where`
- The syntax is `let ... in ...`
- `let` variables are created in the `let` clause
- `in` the function body goes in the `in` clause

## Lexical Scope

**Talking about JavaScript is a total wast of space in the book.**

```haskell
x = 4
add1 y = y + x                 -- x is 4 (from top scope)
add2 y = (\x -> y + x) 3       -- x is 3 (from value passed in)
add3 y = (\y ->
          (\x -> y + x) 1 ) 2  -- y is 2 (from value passed in
                               -- x is 4 (from top scope)
```

- Think all this says is that if a value isn't provided Haskell will look to an outer scope. Seems just like other languages.
