# Working With Text and Unicode

> Commercial Haskell almost always uses `Text`.


Language pragma `OverloadedStrings`
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE <Extension Name> #-}
```



## Common functions

```haskell
sampleInput :: T.Text
sampleInput = "this\nis\ninput"
```

**`T.lines`**
```haskell
> T.lines sampleInput
["this", "is", "input"]
```

| function | Input | Output | comment |
| ---------| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| `T.lines` | `(T.lines "this\nis\ninput")` | ["this","is","input"] | brakes on `\n` only |
| `T.words` | `(T.words "Some\ntext for\t you")` | ["Some","text","for","you"] | brakes on any whitespace character |
| `T.splitON` | `(T.splitOn "simple" "This is simple to do")` | ["This is "," to do"] | breakes on specified text |
| `T.unlines` | `(T.unlines ["this","is","input"])` | "this\nis\ninput\n" | reforms lines |
| `T.unwords` | `(T.unwords ["Some","text","for","you"])` |  "Some text for you" | you see it |
| `T.intercolate` | `(T.intercalate "simple" ["This is "," to do"])` | "This is simple to do" | joins with specified character |


## Monoid operations

- `++` doesn't work on Text because it is only defined on `List` but text is an `array`.
