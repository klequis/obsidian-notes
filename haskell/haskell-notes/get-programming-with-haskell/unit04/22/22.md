# Interacting with the Command Line & Lazy I/O

> In Haskell, when a function name ends in an underscore it indicates that the results will be discarded.

## Function used

| function | use |
| - | - |
| `getArgs :: IO [String]` | Get args from command line |
|`getLine :: IO String`| Get user input |
|`replicateM :: Applicative m => Int -> m a -> m  [a]` | Performs an action n times and returns the result |
|`getContents :: IO String`| Returns all user input as a single string, which is read lazily as it is needed |

## Asides

### Can't run `main` that uses `getArgs` from GHCi

**tryIt.hs**
```haskell
import System.Environment ( getArgs )

main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  print args
```

This code can be run by
```haskell
$ ghc tryIt.hs
$ ./tryIt 3
["3"]
```

But if you try to run main from GHCI
```haskell
Prelude> :l tryIt
Prelude> main 3
<interactive>:6:1: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘t0 -> t’ with actual type ‘IO ()’
    • The function ‘main’ is applied to one argument,
      but its type ‘IO ()’ has none
...
```

However, from stackoverflow I see you can use colon before `main` to get around this:
```haskell
Prelude> :l tryIt
Prelude> :main 3
["3"]
```
