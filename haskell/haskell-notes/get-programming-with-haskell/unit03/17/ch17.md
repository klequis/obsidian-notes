## 17.2 Combining like types: Semigroups

#semigroup

**Semigroup**

> Take two like (same type) things and combine them.

- is a type class
- lives in Data.Semigroup
- Has one operator `<>`
- `<>` could be thought of as an operator for *combining instances of the same type*.
- must satisfy
	- associativity

You **could** define semigroup for `Integer` as
(I don't see this definition in the docs)
```haskell
instance Semigroup Integer where
    (<>) x y = x + y
```

## 17.3 Composing with identity: Monoids
#monoid

**Monoid**

per book: The only _major_ idfference between `Semigroup` & `Monoid` is that `Monoid` requires an identity...

```haskell
x <> id = x
```

...but unexpectedly `mempty` is the identity for `Monoid`. This is for historical reasons (`Monoid` existed in Haskell be fore `Semigroup`)

- `Semigroup` is a superclass
- Must satisfy
	- _right identity_, _left identity_, _associativity_, _concatenation_
- Common monoids:
	- list where `[]` is the identity and `++` is append (`<>` will fail).
- `Monoid`'s methods sound like list functions with 'm' prepended: E.g., `mappend`.
