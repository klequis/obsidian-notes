# 19 The Maybe Type: Dealing with Missing Values

- Whereas `List` and `Map` represent containers for values
- `Maybe` represents a *context* for a value.
- The *context* is that the type contained might be missing
	- There are many types that represent a context
- Where other languages use `null`, Haskell uses `Maybe`

**My summary of above**
Types like `List` & `Map` are containers. `Maybe` is a container iwth a context. The context is that the type contained may be missing.

---

The signature for `Maybe` is
```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

- `Maybe` returns either a `Just` containing a value or a `Nothing`.
- `Just` is a data constructor
