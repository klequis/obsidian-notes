- Functor allows you to perform computations inside 
    - a *container* such as `List`
    - a *context* such as `Maybe` or `IO`

## `fmap` / `<$>`
- `fmap` - apply a function that is not in a container or context to a function that is.
```haskell
> fmap (+1) (Just 1)
Just 2
```

- `<$>` 
    - An alias for `fmap`
    - Is infix
```haskell
> (+1) <$> (Just 1)
Just 2
```

## `Applicative`

- Allows you to apply a function that is in a container or context to a value that is also in a container or context.
```haskell
> (Just (+1)) <*> (Just 1)
Just 2
```
- This allows you to chain together long sequences of computations that are in a context.
