# Functor
For summary see #functor

---

Consider these types
- `[Int]`
- `Map String Int`
- `Maybe Int`
- `IO Int`

and this function
- `Int -> String`

- In most programming languages, a separate `Int` to `String` function for each of the 4 types.
- However, in Haskell, because of the `Functor` type class, you have **a uniform way to apply your single function to all these cases**.


## Example: computing in a Maybe

Say you want to increment a `Maybe Int`. You could write a function that will increment if there is a value and return `Nothing` if there isn't.

```haskell
incMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Maybe Int
incMaybe (Just n) = Just (n + 1)
incMaybe Nothing = Nothing
```

This function is using `(+1)` in a `Maybe`.

If things had to be done this way you would have to write a special version of every function you want to use in a `Maybe`.

> **The `Functor` type class solves this problem.**


## Functor

> `Functor` has a symbol: `<$>`.

### Method `fmap`

The `Functor` class requires only one method: `fmap`.

```haskell
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

In words
- Inputs are s function from `a` to `b` and a `Functor a`
- Returns a `Functor b` 

Note that in the function `(a -> b)`, `a` and `b` are not `Functor`s.

This is shown clearly in the diagram where the far left circle is `f a` (`a` is in a context) and the far right square is `f b` (`b` is in a context) but in the function, the circle (`a`) and the square (`b`) are not in a context. Hence, you take `a` out of the context to produce `b` which is not in a context and then put `b` into a context.

Using `fmap` you no longer need a special function for the above `(+1)` increment function. You can simply do:
```haskell
successfulRequest :: Maybe Int
successfulRequest = Just 6

failedRequest :: Maybe Int
failedRequest = Nothing

GHCi> fmap (+ 1) successfulRequest
Just 7

GHCi> fmap (+ 1)) failedRequest
Nothing
```

Or do the same thing using the `fmap` symbol:
```haskell
GHCi> (+ 1) <$> successfulRequest
Just 7

GHCi> (+ 1) <$> failedRequest
Nothing
```


## Robot part

See the book for the robot part code. Here is the conclusion:

- `Functor`'s `<$>` provides a common interface to apply any function to a value in context.
- For types such as `List` and `Map` it is a convenient way to update their values.
- For `IO` it is essential because you can't take values out of an `IO` context.
