# 28 A PEEK AT THE APPLICATIVE TYPE CLASS: USING FUNCTIONS IN A CONTEXT


## Summary
### - Build an application that handles missing data
 ### - Extend the power of the Functor type class with the Applicative type
### - Use Applicative to use one data model in many contexts

- Using `Maybe` as example context ...
- You have a function that takes 2 `Maybe` arguments and returns a `Maybe`.
- Functor can't handle this so you try partial application.
- Unfortunately, partial application leaves you with a function in a context (`Maybe` in this case). `Functor` can't handle that but `Applicative` can.



## Notes

"In the preceding lesson, you learned how the Functor type class allows you to perform computation inside a **container** such as List or a **context** such as Maybe and IO."

- Apparently the book makes a distinction between **containers** and **contexts**.

### Functor vs Applicative

#### Functor
- Allows you to perform a computation inside a container or context.
- 

#### Applicative
- Extends Functor by allowing you to use *functions that are themselves in a context*.
- Allows you to chain together long sequences of computation in a context such as `IO` or `Maybe`. 

```haskell
-- Functor
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
-- Applicative
(<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b``
--- liftA2
liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
```


```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

class Functor f => Applicative f where
  (<*>) = liftA2 id
  liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c

ghci> :t (<*>)
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

```


**`liftA2`**
Lift a binary function to actions.
```haskell
`liftA2 (,) (Just 3) (Just 5)`
Just (3,5) 

:t (,)
(,) :: a -> b -> (a, b)

```

## 28.2

Key to solving the problem with `Functor` only taking one argument is to use #partial-application in a context.

The real limitation of `Functor`'s `<$>` is that you end up with a function in context through #partial-application and you have no way of using that function.

```haskell
> maybeInc = (+) <$> Just 1
> :t maybeInc
maybeInc :: Num a => Maybe (a -> a)
```
- In the above example `<$>` was used to create a partially applied function. The result is a "function in a context", i.e., `Maybe (a -> a)`.
- But `Functor` requires a function that is not in a context.

If you try to use `maybeInc` as is:
```haskell
> maybeInc (Just 1)
```
You get the following error:
```haskell
• Couldn't match expected type: Maybe a1 -> t
              with actual type: Maybe (a0 -> a0)
• The function ‘maybeInc’ is applied to one value argument,
    but its type ‘Maybe (a0 -> a0)’ has none
  In the expression: maybeInc (Just 1)

```

## 28.2.2

The `<*>` operator takes a function in a context and an argument in the same context, and applies the function to that argument, returning a type still in the context.

## 28.2.3 Using a multi-argument function in IO using <$> and <*>

```haskell
minOfThree :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> a -> a
minOfThree val1 val2 val3 = min val1 (min val2 val3)

readInt :: IO Int
readInt = read <$> getLine
-- How is the different from `x <- read getLine`?
-- Because `getLine` returns an `IO String` and `<$>` applies `read` to the `String` inside `IO`.

minOfInts3 :: IO Int
minOfInts3 = minOfThree <$> readInt <*> readInt <*> readInt

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter three numbers"
  minInt <- minOfInts3
  -- minInt <- minOfInts2
  putStrLn (show minInt ++ " is the smallest")

-- minOfTwo :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> a
-- minOfTwo val1 val2 = min val1 val2

-- minOfInts2 :: IO Int
-- minOfInts2 = minOfTwo <$> readInt <*> readInt
```
