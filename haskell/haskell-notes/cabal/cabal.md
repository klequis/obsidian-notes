# The Haskell Cabal

The term cabal can refer to either: 
- cabal-the-spec (.cabal files), 
- cabal-the-library (code that understands .cabal files), 
- cabal-the-tool (the cabal-install package which provides the cabal executable); 

> Usually folks are referring to cabal-the-tool when they say cabal.
