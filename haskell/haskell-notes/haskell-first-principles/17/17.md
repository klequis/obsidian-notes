In this chapter, we will:
- Define and explore the Applicative type class and its core operations.
- Demonstrate why applicatives are monoidal functors.
- Make the usual chitchat about laws and instances.
- Do a lot of lifting.
- Give you some Validation


```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

The signature show that an `Applicative` is "constrained" by the `Functor` type class. However, (I'm pretty sure) it can be any type that has a `Functor` instance.

`pure` lifts something into an applicative structure (and not into any other type of structure).

## `liftA*`
**p. 676 - 677**

The `Control.Applicative` library provides `liftA`, `liftA2` & `liftA3`.

`liftA` handles a `(a -> b)` like `<*>`

```haskell
liftA :: Applicative f =>
  (a -> b)
  -> f a
  -> f b
```

`liftA2` & `liftA3` handle functions with additional parameters:

```haskell
liftA2 :: Applicative f =>
  (a -> b -> c)
  -> f a
  -> f b
  -> f c

liftA3 :: Applicative f =>
  (a -> b -> c -> d)
  -> f a
  -> f b
  -> f c
  -> f d
```

## p. 698 Maybe Functor and the Name constructor
```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap _ Nothing    = Nothing
  fmap f (Just a)   = Just (f a)

instance Applicative Maybe where
  pure = Just
  Nothing <*> _     = Nothing
  _ <*> Nothing     = Nothing
  Just f <*> Just a = Just (f a)
```
*(The Applicative instance is not exactly the same as the instance in base, but thatâ€™s for simplification.)*
