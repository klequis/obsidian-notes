## Nothing or Just Maybe
`Maybe` is useful here but it doesn't tell you if the problem is `name` or `age`. `Either` can help here.

```haskell
mkPerson :: Name -> Age -> Maybe Person
mkPerson name age
  | name /= "" && age >= 0 = Just $ Person name age
  | otherwise = Nothing
```

## Either left or right



## Higher-kindedness

## Anamorphisms, but not animorphs
