eg = (fmap . fmap) sum Just [1,2,3]

- The lefthand fmap in [B] is instantiated to the ((->) [Integer]) functor.
- The righthand fmap in [B] is instantiated to the Maybe functor.

- Note that HLS gives both the general type of fmap, and the specific type, so itâ€™s extremely useful for answering questions like the ones here.
