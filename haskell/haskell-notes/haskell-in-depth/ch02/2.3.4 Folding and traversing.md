## Traverse

```haskell
class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable (t :: * -> *) where
  traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
...
```

```haskell
traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
```

- `t a` a container of elements. The exact type of `t` is not know outside the scope of a specific example.
- `a -> f b` takes an `a` and returns `a` in `Applicative` context.
