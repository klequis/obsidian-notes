#monad

The IO monad is one of several(/?)many monads in Haskell

Actions are either 
- atomic, as defined in system primitives, 
- or a sequential composition of other actions. 
- The I/O monad contains primitives which build composite actions.
- The monad serves as the glue which binds together the actions in a program.

## 7.1 Basic I/O Operations

- Every I/O action returns a value
- The return type of I/O actions are 'tagged' with the IO type, distinguishing actions from other values.
- Actions that return no interesting value use the unit type `()`
	- `putChar` :: Char -> IO ()
- Actions are sequenced by `>>=` ('bind')
- `do` notation is syntatic sugar for `>>=`

> **"action"**: a pattern bound to the result of an action using `<-`

**`do`**
- Introduces a sequence of statements which are executed in order.
- A statement is either 
	- an action 
	- or a set of local definitions introduced using `let`
 
**Example 1**

```haskell
main  :: IO ()  
main =  do c <- getChar  
                   putChar c
```

This program performs two actions in sequence: 
- first it reads in a character, binding the result to the variable c, 
- then prints the character. 

> Unlike a `let` expression where variables are scoped over all definitions, the variables defined by `<-` are only in scope in the following statements.

- Use `return :: a -> IO a` to return a value

**Example 2**

```haskell
getLine     :: IO String  
getLine     =  do c <- getChar  
				  if c == '\n'  
				       then return ""  
				       else do l <- getLine  
				         return (c:l)
```

- Earch `do` introduces a single chain of statements
- Any intervening construct, such as the `if`, must use a new `do` to initiate further sequences of actions

> the **Trace** package allows you to print during debugging
