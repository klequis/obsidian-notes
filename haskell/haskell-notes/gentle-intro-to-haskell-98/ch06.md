# Types, Again

## 6.1 The Newtype Declaration

`newtype`
- creates a type from an existing one
- the newtype does not get the existing types super classes
- the newtype does not get the old type's instances.


## 6.2 Field Labels

You can define `Point` as
```haskell
data Point = Pt Float Float
```

With field labels it would be difined like
```haskell
data Point = Pt {pointx, pointy :: Float}
```

`Pt {pointx=1, pointy=2}` is identical to `Pt 1 2`

Updating with labels

 ```haskell
 > p = point 1 1
 > p {pointx=2}
 -- p 2 1 
 ```
## 6.3 Strict Data Constructors

- _strictness flags_ in data declarations allow specific fields of a constructor to be evaluated immediately, selectively suppressing laziness.
- A field marked by `!` is a data declaration is evaluated when the structure is created rather than lazily.
- `!` can only be used in data declarations

> Laziness is implemented using thunks
