# 8 Standard Haskell Clases

## 8.2 The Enumberation Class

`Enum` has operations that underlie the syntactic sugar of arighmetric sequencess. E.g:

```haskell
[1,3..]
-- [1,3,5,7,...]
```

This works for most numeric types and for `Char`

```haskell
['a'..'z']
-- "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

And for user-defined types

```haskell
data Color = Red | Green | Blue | Indigo | Violet
	deriving show
```
