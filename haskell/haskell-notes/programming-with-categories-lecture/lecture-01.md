## Sets
Concerned with:
- cardinalities
- sizes of sets
- axioms of sets
- finite, infinite

Set theory never really tells you what a set is.

For us, a set will be a bag of dots.
- You can point to any of its elements
- If two people are pointing you can tell if they are pointing at the same element or not.
