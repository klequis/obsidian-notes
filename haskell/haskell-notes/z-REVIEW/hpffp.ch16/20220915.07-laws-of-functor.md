# Laws of functor

1. Identity
```haskell
fmap id == id
```
"Composing two functions lifted separately is the same as the result of composing the functions first and then lifting them together."

2. Composition
```haskell
fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g
```

Composition example
```haskell
-- these do the same thing
> fmap ((+1) . (*2)) [1..5]
> fmap (+1) . fmap (*2) $ [1..5]
```
