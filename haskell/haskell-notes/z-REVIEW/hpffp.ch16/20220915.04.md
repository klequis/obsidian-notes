**You can't map over a type that takes no arguments!**

```haskell
data FixMePls = FixMe | Pls deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Functor FixMePls where
  fmap = error "it doesn't matter, it won't compile"
```

```haskell
• Expected kind ‘* -> *’, but ‘FixMePls’ has kind ‘*’
• In the first argument of ‘Functor’, namely ‘FixMePls’
  In the instance declaration for ‘Functor FixMePls’
```

- `FixMePls` has no type constructors so there is nothing to map over.


```haskell
(<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  ($) ::              (a -> b) ->   a ->   b
```

-     `($)` - is function application
- `(<$>)` - Functor is a type class for function application “over” or “through” some structure.
