In Haskell, there are seven categories of entities that have names:
- functions, 
- term-level variables, 
- data constructors, 
- type variables, 
- type constructors, 
- type classes, and 
- modules. 

- **Term-level** variables and **data constructors** exist in your terms. 
- **Term level** is where your values live and is the code that executes when your program is running. 
- Athe **type level**, which is used during the static analysis and verification of your program, we have **type variables**, **type constructors**, and **type classes**. 
- Lastly, for the purpose of organizing our code into coherent groupings across different files, we have **modules**.
