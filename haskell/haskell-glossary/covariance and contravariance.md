#covariance, #contravariance

[Covariance and contravariance (computer science), Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science))


Seems to relate to 
- subtyping: Animal vs Cat classes type of thing.
- the **vairance** depends on the type constructor
- wherein the relation of the types/classes maybe **preserved**, **reversed** or **ignored**

## Covariant

- The relation of the subtype  to supertype is preserved
- It is the quality of being different by being more specific
	- `Cat` is #covariant to `Animal`

## Contravariance

- The quality of being different by being more general
	- `Animal` is #contravariant to `Cat`
