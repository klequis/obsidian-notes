# #isomorphism, #isomorphic


**Isomorphism:** An _isomorphism_ is an equivalence between two data types that have the same information. An isomorphism is defined by two functions: one to translate from the first data type to the second; and one to translate from the second data type to the first. These functions must satisfy “round-trip” laws in order for them to form an isomorphism, which demonstrate the two representations contain the same information. In functional programming, many things are considered equal _up to isomorphism_. For example, `(A, Unit)` and `A` are _equal up to isomorphism_, meaning these two different types have the same information.

**Isomorphism in mathematics:** an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them.
