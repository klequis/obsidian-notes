# #pattern-matching

- **Pattern matching** is a syntactic way of deconstructing product and sum types to get at their inhabitants. 
- With respect to products, pattern matching gives you the means for destructuring and exposing the contents of products, binding one or more values contained therein to names. 
- With sums, pattern matching lets you discriminate which inhabitant of a sum you mean to handle in that match. 
- It’s best to explain pattern matching in terms of how datatypes work, so we’re going to use terminology that you may not fully understand yet. *(HPFFP p. 269)*.
