# #algebra

## In mathematics

The study of mathematical symbols and the rules governing their manipulation.

It is differentiated from arithmetic by its use of abstractions such as variables.

By the use of variables, we’re saying we don’t care much what value will be put into that slot. We care about the rules of how to manipulate this thing without reference to its particular value.

## In Haskell

One or more *operations* and the *set* they operate over.

Can be implemented with **type classes** which define the set of operations.

The *set* is the *type* for the *operations* are for.

The **instance** defines how each operation will perform for a given type/set.

**Algebras** are defined by their **laws** and are useful principally for their laws. Laws make up what algebras are.

**Monoid** is an algebra.

> Algebras give us guarantees of how things will behave.
