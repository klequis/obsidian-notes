# #type-class

**Type classes** give us a way to recognize, organize, and use common functionalities and patterns across types that differ in some ways but also have things in common.

- A type class defines a set of functions and/or values.
- Types have instances of that type class.
- The instances specify the ways that type uses the functions of the type class.
