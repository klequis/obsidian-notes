# Function

In mathematics, a **function** from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ assigns to each element of $X$ exactly one element of $Y$.

- The set $X$ is called the **domain** of the function.
- The set $Y$ is called the **codomain** of the function.

A function is most often denoted by letters such as $f$, $g$ and $h$, and the value of a function $f$ at an element $x$ of its domain is donated by $f(x)$.
