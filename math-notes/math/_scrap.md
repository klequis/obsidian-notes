## Absolute Compliment

Denoted: $A^c$

$A^c = U \setminus A$
or
$A^c = \{x \in U : x \notin A\}$

The absolute compliment of $A$ is the set of values where $x$ is a member of $U$ and $x$ is not a member of $A$.

$A \setminus B = A \cap B^c$

A = {1,2,3,4}
B = {2,3}

$A \setminus B = \{1,4\}$
$A \cap B^c = $

A = {1,2,3,4}
$B^c$ = {1,4}
