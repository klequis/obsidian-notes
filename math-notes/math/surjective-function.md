# Surjective function

In mathemetics, a surjective function (aka: surjection, onto function) is
- A function where every element in X maps to one and only one element in Y
- Two or more elements in X can map to the same element in Y.

A function `f` with domain `X` and codomain `Y` is surjective if for every `y` in `Y` there exists at least one `x` in `x` with `f(x) = y`.
