# Inverse function

In mathematics, the **inverse function** of a function `f` ("the inverse of `f`") is a function that undoes the operation of `f`. 

The inverse of `f` exists if and only if `f` is bijective. It is denoted by $f^{-1}$.

The inverse of $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is $f^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X$.

**Example 1**

The inverse of $f(x) = 5x - 7$ is $f^{-1}(y) = (y + 7)/5$.

If x = 3 then y = 8
- 5(3) - 7 = 8
- (8 + 7)/5 = 3

**Example 2**

Let $f$ be a function whose domain is set $X$ and whose codomain is set $Y$.

Then $f$ is invertible if there exists a function $g$ from $Y$ to $X$ such that both:
- $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in X$ 
- $f(g(y)) = y$ for all $y \in Y$



And that is what happened in **Example 1** - or is it?

So the inverse of $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is $f^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X$. Let's rename $f$ as $h$ and $f^{-1}$ as $g$.

When $x$ is 3 does $g(f(x)) = f(g(y))$?

1. $g(f(x))$

g(f(3))

f(3) = 8
g(8) = 3

2. $f(g(y))$

g(8) = 3
