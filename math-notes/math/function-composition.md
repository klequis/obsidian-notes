# Function composition

In mathematics, **function composition** is an operation $\cdot$ that takes two functions $f$ and $g$ and produces a function $h = g \cdot f$.

That is $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and $g: Y \rightarrow Z$ are composed to yield a function that maps $X$ to $g(f(x))$ in codomain $Z$. The resulting composit function is denoted as $g \cdot f: X \rightarrow Z$ and defined by $(g \cdot f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for all $x$ in $X$.
