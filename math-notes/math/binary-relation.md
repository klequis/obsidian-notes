# Binary relation

- In mathematics, a binary relation associates elements of one set, called the domain, with elements of another set, called the codomain. 
- A binary relation over sets X and Y is a new set of ordered pairs (x, y) consisting of elements x in X and y in Y. 
- It is a generalization of the more widely understood idea of a mathematical function, but with fewer restrictions
