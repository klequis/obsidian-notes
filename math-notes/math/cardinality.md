# Cardinality

**Cardinality:** Is a measure of the number of elements of a set. The set `A = {2,4,6}`  has a cardinality of 3.

The *cardinality* of $A$ is often written as $|A|$.

The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number.

Infinite sets have cardinalities but they are not natural numbers
