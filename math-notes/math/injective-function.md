# Injective function
> aka **injection** or **one-to-one-function**

In mathematics, an **injective function** (also known as injection, or one-to-one function) is a function f that maps distinct elements to distinct elements; that is, f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2. 

In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain.

The term one-to-one function must not be confused with one-to-one correspondence that refers to bijective functions, which are functions such that each element in the codomain is an image of exactly one element in the domain.
