# Set & set



**A set:** A collection of elements.
- Order of a set's elements does not matter. {1,2} is the same as {2,1}
- In a sequence, tuple or permutation of a set, order does matter.
- A set can be finite or infinite.

**Element:** An element (aka member) of a set is any one of the distinct objects that below to that set.

**Example:**

- `A = {1,2,3,4}` means the elements of set `A` are the numbers 1, 2, 3, & 4.
- Sets made of elements from `A` are *subsets* of `A`.
- A set can be an element `B = {1,2,{3,4}}`.

**Set** is the *category of **sets***. 
- Objects are sets and morphisms (arrows) are functions.
	- In other words **Set** is a category that contains **sets**.
	- While the category **Set** contains **sets**, other categoies do not contain **sets**.
- The arrows between sets are **total functions** (see [[partial-and-total-functions]]).
- Set satisfies the exioms of a category (associative & identity).
