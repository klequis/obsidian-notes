# Binary relation

#binary-relation

A **binary relation** is a property that describes whether two objects are related in some way.

E.g.,
* Less-than: $x \lt y$ 
* Divisibility: $x$ divides $y$ evenly
* Friendship: $x$ is a friend of $y$
* Tastiness: $x$ is tastier than $y$

Notation
- Given binary relation $R$, we write $aRb$ iff $ a is related to $b$ by relation $R$.
