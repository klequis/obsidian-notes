# Cartesian product

## Notation
$A \times B$

## Definition
In mathematics, specifically set-theory, the, the **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$ denoted $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a$ is in $A$ and $b$ is in $B$.

## Example 1
$A = \{brown, green, yellow\}$
$B = \{red, blue, purple\}$

The number of elements in a Cartesian product is the product of the cardinality of the sets. In the current example it is $3 \times 3 = 9$.

$A \times B$ consists of:
- (brown, red), 
- (brown, blue), 
- (brown, purple), 
- (green, red), 
- (green, blue), 
- (green, purple), 
- (yellow, red), 
- (yellow, blue), 
- (yellow, purple)

Note that the Cartesian product does not include an element paired with itself $\{brown, brown\}$ nor elements reversed $\{red, brown\}$

## Example 2

- If $S$ and $T$ are sets,
- the cartesian product of $S$ and $T$ is the set $S \times T$ of ordered pairs $(s,t)$,
- where $s \in S$ and $t \in T$.
- Note that order matters: $S \times T$ requires $(s,t)$, not $(t,s)$.
	- $(t,s)$ would be the cartesian product of $T \times S$.

### In Setbuilder Notation

- If $S$ and $T$ are sets ,
- the cartesian product of $S$ and $T$ in set builder notation is,
- $S \times T = \{(s,t) | s \in S \hspace{0.1cm} and \hspace{0.1cm} t \in T\}$

## Use of $|$
- $|$ in $\{x|x \hspace{0.1cm} is\hspace{0.1cm} a \hspace{0.1cm} natural \hspace{0.1cm} number \hspace{0.1cm} and \hspace{0.1cm} x < 8\}$,
- should be read as,
- "The set of all x such that x is a natural number and is less than 8".
