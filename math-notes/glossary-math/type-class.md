Type classes give us a way to recognize, organize, and use common functionalities and patterns across types that differ in some ways but also have things in common.

For example, addition is a type of common functionality/pattern:
- There are many types of numbers
- but all of them can be arguments in addition
- `Num` type class has an addition operator.
