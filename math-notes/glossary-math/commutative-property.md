# #commutative-property

In mathematics, a binary operation is **commutative** if changing the order of the operands does not change the result.

Examples
- $3 + 4 = 4 + 3$
- $2 × 5 = 5 × 2$

 It is similar to #binary-relation  which is said to be #symmetric.

Commutative can be expressed as $f(a,b)=f(b,a)$
- In other words, the order of the arguments passed to the function will not change the result.
