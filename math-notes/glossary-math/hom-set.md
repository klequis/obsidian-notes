from: [morphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism#Hom-set), Wikipedia

The collection of all morphisms from X to Y is denoted HomC(X,Y) or simply Hom(X, Y) and called the **hom-set** between X and Y. Some authors write MorC(X,Y), Mor(X, Y) or C(X, Y). 

Note that the term hom-set is something of a misnomer, as the collection of morphisms is not required to be a set; a category where Hom(X, Y) is a set for all objects X and Y is called locally small. Because hom-sets may not be sets, some people prefer to use the term "hom-class".

A **hom-set** is a set/collection/class/group of morphisms between two categories. It isn't really a set.
