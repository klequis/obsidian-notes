# Reflexivity
#reflexivity #irreflexive

A "property of relations".

> **Reflexivity**: Is an element of the set related to itself?

* **Reflexive**: every element is related to itself
* **Irreflexive**: no element is related it itself
* Neither reflexive nor irreflexive: some elements are related to themselves but some are not.

The operators $\leq$ and $=$ on real numbers are reflexive, but $<$ is irreflexive. Huh?
- $2\leq2$ - true
- $2=2$ - true
- $2<2$ - false

Suppose a remation $M$ on integers by $xMy$ if, and only if $x+y=0$.
- In this case $2$ is not related to itself but $0$ is.

Formal definition: if $R$ is a relation on a set $A$ then
- $R$ is **reflextive** if $xRx$ for all $x \in A$.
- R is **irreflexive** if $x\cancel{R}y$  for all $x \in A$.
