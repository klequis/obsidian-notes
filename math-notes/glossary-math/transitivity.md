# Transitivity

#transitivity 

A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is **transitive** if

- transitive: for all $a,b,c \in A$, $aRb$ and $bRc$ implies that $aRc$.

**Transivity** holds true for a broad range of numerical relations such as $<$, $=$, $/$, and set inclusion. E.g.,
- if $x<y$ and $y<z$, then $x<z$.
- For sets, $X \subseteq Y$ and $Y \subseteq Z$ implies that $X \subseteq Z$.
- if $x|y$ and $y|z$, then $x|z$.

> Not sure of $|$ in the last bullet. When [looked up](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/Basic_Math_Symbols.html) it means "such that".

**not transitive** there are $a,b,c \in A$, $aRb$ and $bRc$ and $a \cancel{R} c$.
