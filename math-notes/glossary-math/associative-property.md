# #associative-property


## In Math
Rearranging the parentheses in an express will not change the result.

Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.

An associative operation may or may not also be [[commutative-property|commutative]].
