#morphism

Category C consists of two classes
1. objects
2. morphisms

There are two objects associated with every morphism
1. source (aka: domain)
2. target (aka: codomain)

A morphism $f$ with source $X$ and target $Y$ is writeen $f:X \to Y$

For many common categories, objects are sets and morphisms are function from an object to another object. Therefore the source and target of a morphism are often called *domain* and *codomain* respectively.

Morphisms are equiped with a #par
