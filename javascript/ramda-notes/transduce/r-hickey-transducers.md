Let's call them "process transformations"

Not all processes but those that can be
- a succession of steps
- it is a **seeded left reduce**

- **reduce:** to lead back
- **ingest:** carry into
- **transduce:** lead across
- "On the way back/in, will carry **inputs** across a series of **transformations**."

Transducers are like many processes in the real world.

- mapping returns a transducer
- filtering returns a transducer
- mapcatting returns a transducer
- cat is a transducer

transducers take a function, wraps it, and returns a new step function.
